Mall Customer Clustering Machine Learning Model using K-Means unsupervised algorithm

We want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge (Target Customers) so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

This ML model is created for the purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . This model is designed by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.

The basic procedures implemented to achieve the goals of this research are:

1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning and wrangling
3. Data Analysis and Visualization
4. Feature encoding
5. Modeling
6. Model accuracy evaluation
7. Measure loss value

a. Programming Language - Python
b. Libreary/Packages - Numpy,Pandas,MatPlotlib,Seaborn,Scikit-learn
c. Statistical Algorithm - K-Means
